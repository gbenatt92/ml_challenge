# API

Although no API was made for both receiving data and giving data, I'd like to briefly discuss each point.

## Interface

A good interface would require good level of concise documentation coupled to a API that returns and receives easy to understand data. 

Although not necessary, examples and a small test suite in the website would be nice as well.

## Scalability and Robustness

Even though I'm currently using Spark, for better scalability and robustness to error, it's recommended to use Scala. 

Scala allows for easier parallelization, meaning more requests can be given per minute, while also marrying nice with Spark and being able to utilize better features of the framework.
